# Shrimp Data Entry Project
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
A Python/Kivy-based data-entry application for recording and managing shrimp sample data.
The app provides multiple screens for entering general information, performing calculations,
viewing history and summaries, and accessing contact/about pages. Data is stored locally
using `db.py`. The application is launched from `main.py`, UI screens are implemented in
the `screen_*.py` modules, and `persian_helper.py` offers Persian localization support.
Included assets (fonts and images) are in the `assets/` folder. Use `buildozer.spec` to
package the app for Android if you want a mobile build.
