# Shrimp Data Entry Project
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/cSiOcsirqk4
#### Description:
A Python/Kivy-based data-entry application for recording and managing shrimp sample data.
The app provides multiple screens for entering general information, performing calculations,
viewing history and summaries, and accessing contact/about pages. Data is stored locally
using `db.py`. The application is launched from `main.py`, UI screens are implemented in
the `screen_*.py` modules, and `persian_helper.py` offers Persian localization support.
Included assets (fonts and images) are in the `assets/` folder. Use `buildozer.spec` to
package the app for Android if you want a mobile build.

**The main project started with a recommendation from an organization in Iran**, and the plan was to create an interactive application
Which online database, including SQL and a great webpage for administrators. But unfortunately, the organization postponed their agreement
And as far as I had to submit my project, I decided to change it a little bit to submit my project and then I can wait for them to decide.

The only place that I didn't use Python to program was smartphones, so I accepted the project and I couldn't handle the whole project based on my knowledge, especially from your course,
And the only dark area for me was a smart phone programming, which I decided to use Kivy. That was a great experience for me and thank you for giving this experience.
